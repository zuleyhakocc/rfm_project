In this project we're going to segment the customers of an online retail company. The dataset used in this project is "Online Retail II" dataset and it contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
